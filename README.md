# hello-world
This is the creation of my first repository

I am incredibly new to coding. This is my first day accessing Github. I am a brewer and graphic designer (primarily print). I feel like coding is the next logical step in my educational journey, and a great compliment to my design background. 

My analog hobbies include overlanding, offroading, Toyota trucks, & any and all things related to the outdoors.
